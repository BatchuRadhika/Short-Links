    URL shortening is a way to shorten long, complex URLs into much shorter, neater packages that still send you to the original URL. Here’s an example to show you how URL shortening works:

You can shorten https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/2022/02/10/amtrak-deal-valentines-offer-sale/6741296001/ to https://bit.ly/3Bg19uM.

The latter looks better and evokes more trust as it’s less spammy-looking. It also leaves you room to share more details with your target audience when posting on social media sites with character limits.

For example, unless you’re a Blue subscriber on X, you can only post tweets with 240 characters or less. With a long link like the one above, you won’t have space to offer details on what the link is about within the same post.

With Bitly, you can go beyond shortening by customizing your links. For instance, you can shorten the above link to https://bit.ly/amtrak-valentines, adding a custom phrase to the back half. You can make your links even more personal by using custom domain names instead of the bit.ly domain.

What is a URL shortener?
A URL shortener or link shortener is an app that condenses web addresses, redirecting the shorter URL to the original. There are plenty of free and paid URL shorteners available, like Bitly, and apps like X (formerly Twitter) and WordPress often include automatic URL shortening on their platforms.

General-use URL shorteners usually have a free version that offers shortening and other basic services. However, the paid versions typically provide additional services, like advanced tracking, bulk shortening, and campaign management.

So, how does a URL shortening tool work?

When you submit a long link to a tool like Bitly, it generates an identification code in the form of a short URL or alias. Then a database associates the short URL with your original URL to facilitate future reference.

When a potential lead clicks the short URL, your shortening tool receives the request and crawls its database to find the original link. When it does, it issues an HTTP redirect response to the potential lead’s browser and navigates them to the original URL, which displays your web page.

The shortening service doesn’t show the redirect process to your target audience—it’ll seem like they’re just opening a regular link. And it only takes a few seconds, so you don’t have to worry about lagging.

What is the purpose of a URL shortener?
A URL shortener aims to convert long web addresses into shorter links that display better. Some link shorteners only provide shortening, while more sophisticated apps may add tracking and analytics.

Link shorteners gained popularity when X limited tweets to 140 characters. Then, a longer link could have taken up the entire word count since every character in the link counted.

Today, all X links count as 23 characters. However, truncated URLs remain a best practice to distribute content across all social networks and other channels, including X.

What is a URL shortening service?
A URL shortening service is a web app that reduces the length of Uniform Resource Locators to short, alphanumeric codes. The service maintains the connection between the original long link and the shortened version.

Some URL shortening services also include link tracking for analytics to monitor the number of clicks, traffic patterns, and other stats. Digital professionals also use URL shorteners to A/B test which links resonate best with their audiences.

In addition, shortened links enable link masking—a natural consequence of URL shortening. Masked links can help analysis and software programs track where links originate, and they also increase affiliate link clicks to sell products or services.
